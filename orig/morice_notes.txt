2. 
oὐδὲν] Adverbial. See Vocabulary. 
τῶν ἁλισκομένων] Hints, Obs. 13 (4).

ἐπιτάσσει] Understand ‘the payment of,’ etc.
ὥστε κατέχεσθαι] See Vocabulary for ὤστε with infinitive. You will find it with a finite mood a little further on.
οὐκέτι, οὐδείς...οὐδέποτε] In English a string of negatives cancel one another; in Greek they only strengthen the first negative. In construing you should drop all but the first. ‘No longer any one...ever.’

4. 
ἀμυνόμενοι] ‘In self-defence.’ 
οὐδὲ...οὐδεὶς] See 3 (last note).
ἐπὶ μακρὸν] ἐπὶ with acc. often signifies extension over: ‘a long way.’

οἱ δὲ ἀφικόμενοι] οἱ is pronoun, not article. 
κατετόξευσαν] Hints, Obs. 5 and 8.

6. 
τὸ μὲν πρῶτον] Adverbial, ‘in the first place.’
ἀπέθανε] Hints, Obs. 4. Note that this verb is used chiefly of violent deaths; ‘to die (simply)’ is τελευτᾶν.

ἤρθη] Hints, Obs. 7.

9. 
κατέστη] Hints, Obs. 8, B, and Obs. 4.
οἱ πολλοὶ] ‘The many,’ i.e. ‘most.’ Without article it would be simply ‘many.’ 
προὐθυμήθησαν] Hints, Obs. 6. 
σημείου...γενομένου] Genit. absol., used exactly like Latin ablat. absol.

10.
αὕτη] Note accent and breathing. From οὗτος, not αὐτος.

ἀνέῳξεν] Hints, Obs. 7. 
κατέχωσαν] From καταχώννυμι. 

11. 
ἔδοξεν] Impersonal, ‘it seemed good.’ 
ὧν αὐτος ἔχει] ἔχω governs an accusative; but here, as often, the relative pronoun is attracted into the case of its antecedent (κτημάτων).

12. 
τί βουλόμενος] Literally, ‘wishing what,’ i.e. ‘with what object.’ 
αἰσχύνομαι] Note that this word with an infinitive means ‘to be ashamed to do a thing (and so not do it).’ With a participle it means ‘to be ashamed of doing a thing (and yet do it).’ Which is it here?

13.
οὐδενὶ...οὐδεπώποτε] See 3 (last note). 
τἠν γνάθον] i.e. his hard, horny beak.

14. 
κεράσαι] Where we talk of ‘pouring out’ a cup of wine, the Greeks talk of ‘mixing’ it. Greek wine was a thick kind of syrup, which had to be ‘mixed’ with water before drinking.
πολλὰ μεταξὺ, etc.] This is a Hexameter verse. χειλέος would have been χείλους if it had been prose. Take πέλει before μεταξὺ.
τούτων λεγομένων] Genit. absol. Note the tense, — ‘while these things were being...;’ not ‘when these things had been...'
ἡ δὲ περὶ, etc.] Hints, Obs. 13 (2).

15.
ἔθει] For ἔ-θε-ε.
ὡς θέρους ὄντος] Notice ὡς with genit. absol.: ‘as it was,’ etc.
ἐδίψη] A few verbs in -αω contract αε into η, not (like τιμάω) into α.
λάβοι] Optative, because in final sentences in Greek, ‘Optatives follow past tenses, Subjunctives follow primary.’ This answers to the Latin rule, ‘Past tenses of the Subjunctive follow past tenses of the principal verb; primary tenses follow primary.’ (But the Latin rule is much more strictly observed than the Greek. For though in Greek Optatives never depend on a present, Subjunctives often follow a past.)

16. 
τῶν μήλων] Partitive gen., ‘after the...’ 
μεταξὺ ἐσθίων] Literally, ‘meanwhile eating,’ i.e. ‘while he was eating.’ 
τοσαῦτα] refers to the past speech, τοσάδε would refer to something which was to follow. (τοιαῦτα and ταῦτα differ in the same way from τοιάδε and τάδε).

17. τὸυς...πεσόντας] Hints, Obs. 13 (2). ἀεὶ, ‘from time to time,’ See Vocabulary. 
τοῦ συναποθανεῖν] Hints, Obs. 13 (6). Understand here, ‘the privilege of dying,’ etc.

σταθμόν] ‘Halting-place,’ where the king would lodge that night. 

20.

ὅτι τάχιστα] Look out ὅτι. 
οὐδὲν] Adverbial. 
εἶναι] Infinitive, because the Oratio Obliqua still continues, So ὕδωρ and ἱκανὸν must be accusatives.

21.
παράδεισος] A sort of park or private nursery-garden, in which a a great lord might rear valuable or curious plants, etc. Hence our word ‘Paradise.’
Μίθραν] See Vocabulary of Proper Names.

22.

ἐκάθητο] One would have expected the augment to follow the κατὰ (Hints, Ods, 4), but the Greeks seem to have forgotten that the word was a compound.
εὐθὺς ἀφικόμενος] Literally, ‘Directly...arriving,’ i.e. ‘Directly, when he arrived.’ (Compare 16, second note.)

24. 
σκεψόμενον] Fut. participles often express purpose. Construe ‘to...’ (i.e. ‘in order to...’).

25.
ἐκ δὲ τούτων] ‘Thereupon.’ 
περι-ῄρει]  (περι-ε-αίρε-ε) from περιαιρέω. Ovid, and one of the Homeric Hymns, give a different and more pleasing version of this Story. The child is not hurt, but merely left by the offended goddess to grow up an ordinary mortal.

26.
ἐμβάλλων] Construe this Participle as a Gerund, ‘by...’ 
εἰώθει] Plupf. in form, impf. in meaning.

καλοί τε καὶ ἀγαθοὶ] These two words together make up the Greek idea of a perfect gentleman, καλός denoting all dodily excellence, ἀγαθός the perfection of mind and character.

77. 
εἰ δὲ μὴ] μὴ in this phrase negatives the whole preceding clause. Thus, after an affirmative clause, it may be construed — ‘but if not;’ after a negative — ‘but if so;’ in either case — ‘or else’ will represent it fairly accurately.

108. 
ἐκεῖσε] i.e. οἴκαδε.

A Spartan general named Gylippus came to the relief of Syracuse (which was all but thoroughly blockaded by the Athenians), and wrested one position after another from the invaders. The Syracusans plucked up courage, and engaged the Athenians in two seafights, of which the last was entirely in their favour.

248.
ὡς δὴ ὄντες] ‘On the pretence of being.’
τὰ ἔνδοθεν] τὰ ἔνδον would mean ‘the affairs én (the city)’; these, being reported beyond its walls, become τὰ ἔνδοθεν  —  the things from within.’ Strictly speaking, then, they should not be called τὰ ἔνδοθεν till the reporting them is over. But the Greek idiom anticipates the result of the reporting them, and calls them ἔνδοθεν while they are still only deing reported (i.e. while they are still ἔνδον). Such an anticipation is common in Greek, and is called Prolepsis (πρόληψις, πρὸ — λαμβάνω). [Here is another instance: οἱ ἐκ τῆς πόλεως ἐξέφευγον, lit. ‘those out of the city kept fleeing out,’ i.e. ‘those in the city,’ etc. Of course, after they had fled, it would be right to call them ‘those out of the city.’ But the Greek anticipates this, and calls them ‘those out of the city’ by Prolepsis, while they are still fleeing, and are not yet outside the walls.] 

250. 
πρῶτον...ἡγούμενον] Predicates. Understand, after τὸ Νικίου, μέρος.

ἐπ αὐτῷ] ‘Over against it,’ £2 guarding the passage.

251. 
ἐπὶ πολλῶν ἀσπίδων] ἐπὶ, ‘resting on, leaning on the support of’; ἀσπίδων implies hoplites bearing them (the ἀσπις being a necessary part of a hoplite’s equipment). So the whole phrase means ‘resting on the support of many ranks of hoplites,’ and may be construed ‘many ranks deep.’

252. 
ἀποτειχιοῦντας] The Attic form of the future of many verbs in -ιζω is -ιῶ,
μᾶλλον πρὸς] To be taken closely together. 
τότε μὲν...τότε δὲ] ‘At times ... and at times again.’

253. 
μηκέτι] Not οὐκέτι, because ἐβουλεύοντο expresses purpose.

259. 
ἅμα μὲν...ἅμα δὲ] ‘At once... and.’

ἑαυτῷ χρῆσθαι ὅ τι, etc.] ‘To do with him whatever,’ etc. This construction should be noticed, being highly idiomatic, and a great favourite with Attic writers.
μέγιστος καὶ οὐδενὸς ἐλάσσων] Observe the emphatic repetition of the same idea, first in a positive, then in a negative form. A similar figure is very common in the Bible: ‘They shall fall down, and not be able to stand,’ ‘I shall live, and not die,’ ‘Her time is near to come, and her days shall not be prolonged.’

261. 
λιθοτομίας] These λιθοτόμιαι served as a public prison for all Sicily. They were called also λατόμιαι (λᾶας, ‘a stone’). The Romans borrowed the word in the form ‘Lautumiae’; and applied it not only to this place, but to their own public prison at Rome, the ‘Tullianum.’
